            <h2>Commits to deepen our advocacy of quality education through focused efforts on increasing awareness among teachers, leaders, and parents of the barriers faced by children with disabilities.

                We have made inclusion a cross-cutting theme in our program activities. We try to ensure that our trainers and partners (teachers, school leaders, and parents) receive teaching and leadership practices needed to take care of the needs of all the learners, with a focus on those with special needs that could go unnoticed or get lost in those of the majority.
                
                All training modules focus on an approach to teaching and learning that is child-centered. The first place to start is with attitude and beliefs about children, about learning, and about the role of the teacher. We believe that every child can learn if they are given appropriate support. This can represent a significant shift in a teacher’s beliefs about children and their potential, and opens up teachers to see that while each child has individual learning needs, they all equally deserve attention and care.
                
                We look to the future and realize we have our work cut out for us. We will fight for the rights of every child to break these barriers and ensure that every child access an education that treats them with value and justice.
                
                We constantly seek to ensure that every student in Rwanda has access to a quality education, one that treats them with dignity and worth, and equips them with the tools, knowledge, character and skills to achieve their God-given potential.
                
                When we say quality education for every child, we mean it. Every child. No matter what.
                
                So, we won’t stop until every student, with or without a learning disability, accesses the dignity and opportunity that a life-giving and life-changing quality education provides. <u>Will you join us in this work?</u></b></h2>
